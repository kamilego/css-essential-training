          <h1>Kamil Legowicz</h1>
          <h2>Civil Engineer and self-taught programmer</h2>
          <p>As a Civil Engineer I have two specializations. I have graduated Designing Roads and Highways & Engineering structures modelling. Also have experience on construction site and design offices.</p>
          <p>During time I found coding as something very interesting. Mainly I focus on Puthon, but by the time I started learning other languages like JavaScript by making curses. After months I have created some projects figured out by my own and saved in <a href="https://github.com/kamilego?tab=repositories" target="_blank">my repositories</a> on github site.</p>

            <h3>Domes generator</h3>
            <p>This script is over 80% of my masters thesis. Main goal is to automate sensitivity
              analysis of domes constructions by creating many files with modified vertices of
              hemispherical domes. User can by own set height, cross-section, material and
              loads. Due this solution it is easy to find right size of dome were possible is to
              show the power of sensitivity analysis.</p>

            <h3>Antennas rotate solver</h3>
            <p>Script automates boring and monotonous task which is to setup antennas with
              right azimuth in AutoCAD program. User sets values of degrees and types of
              antennas. Python takes control of mouse and keyboard and in a short time does
              all donkey work. It helps a lot and saves a lot of time.</p>

            <p>Scripts help with analysis of forces/displacements of existing lattice mast which
              are overload. Autodesk Robot program provides FEM calculations and returns as
              a result csv file that contains over 200 thousand lines of data. Main goal is to sort
              and manipulate data with certain way to save them in excel file.</p>
